│   ├── src/            # Source code
│   └── README.md       # Frontend-specific documentation
├── backend/            # Server-side application (placeholder for future development)
└── README.md           # Project overview (this file)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Running the Frontend Application

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
